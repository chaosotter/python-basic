# Python BASIC

## What's this all about?

This project is aimed as creating a Microsoft-compatible BASIC interpreter in
pure Python, capable of running programs from old books and magazines from the
heyday of micros in the 80s.

The interpreter is not yet functional, but it's a fairly straightforward
translation of an earlier Javascript version, and I'm old hat at implementing
interpreters.  Be patient, and it will come. :)
